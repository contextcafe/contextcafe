  content: `
Article 14 of the Constitution guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of the laws.

The provision does not prohibit classification. What it prohibits is class legislation. The Supreme Court has consistently held that classification is permissible if it satisfies two conditions:

1. The classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia.
2. The differentia must have a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.

Over time, Article 14 has evolved from a narrow equality clause to a broad guarantee against arbitrariness, particularly after the decision in E.P. Royappa and Maneka Gandhi.
